# Create a program upcase_it.py (again!)
# This program must be executable.
# You must define a method in this program. This method is called upcase_it.
# The upcase_it method takes a string as an argument. It should return the string in uppercase.
# Test the method by calling it in your program. In the example below, we test it with "hello"
