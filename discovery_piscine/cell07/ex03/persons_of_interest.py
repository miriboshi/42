# Create a script called persons_of_interest.py.
# It will contain a method called famous_births.
# This method will take a dictionary representing historical figures as a parameter. 
# Each entry in the dictionary is itself a dictionary with the keys: :name and :date_of_birth.
# The method will sort the dictionary passed as a parameter in order of birth dates, and then display each entry (see the example below).
# For example, the following script
